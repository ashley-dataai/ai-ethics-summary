# ai-ethics-summary

This project presents a research-based overview of ethical concerns related to Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the context of healthcare and data analytics.

## Key Topics Covered
- Algorithmic bias and fairness
- Privacy and surveillance
- Accountability and transparency
- Real-world examples of AI misuse

## Personal Reflection
This summary is based on insights from my coursework in Artificial Intelligence (CAI 1001C). I explored how bias in datasets and lack of transparency in models can lead to harmful outcomes, especially in critical sectors like medicine. I also examined possible solutions like explainable AI (XAI) and the role of ethics in model design.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Research and synthesis
- Technical writing
- Understanding of AI ethics frameworks
